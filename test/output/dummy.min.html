It uses an onchain webpage to allow users to interact with it.</p><p>Each transfer is subject to a 1% pass fee tax, which is claimable by the deployer of the Torch.</p><br><p>NOTE: There is no roadmap, and users of Torch understand and agree that there is no plan to profit from it. The contracts have not been audited, and users assume full responsibility for any loss.</p></div></div><div class="column"><div class="box box-inner" id="svg-box"><!-- [SVG stuff here] --></div></div></div></body>
